; Lines beginning in a semicolon are comments
; New lines can be escaped with a backslash (\), meaning the new line will be kept in the string and will not break into the next label. If you've worked with C/C++ macros, this is similar.
; Spaces around the colon will be stripped
; For non-english translations, labels not present will fall back to english.
; Note that not all labels are present here, as they use Stand's built-in translations.
